This section contains information on the four main releases from Sohnee. The first edition of the Cicatrization LP included a transparent 3D CD case and is ultra-rare.

As well as the four official releases, there were several promotional single releases including Evil Angel and Catch Me, which were only available at live shows and had limited pressings.

> The disc kicks off with the foot tapping, Goth rocking, title track. The bass keeps it low down while the guitar layers lead us on a Therapy like trip to the chorus whereupon the distantly haunting backing vocals add some real depth to the track. Sullen in places, but rocking throughout, this is a worthy title track. <cite>Pete Habert</cite>

> Sohnee took over the stage and confidently engaged the crowd with a well structured, Spartan sound reminiscent of Husker Du, Therapy and even Buffalo Tom in places. Stand out song ‘Insanity’ certainly raced by like a short sharp shock and it was the high tempo songs that came across best. <cite>Paul Maidment</cite>

> However, the melancholy mood is soon lifted with the forever fresh, ‘The Girl With Long Black Hair’. Raised from the album ‘Cicatrization’, this tune has all the hallmarks of a great up-tempo Goth/pop anthem which could well be worthy of a chart placing given the right airplay. It’s just one of those tunes where that chorus is going to pop right back into your head when you least expect it [… ] For me ‘Insanity’ is the best track on this e.p. In fact I would go as far as to say that, if it wasn’t for the delay used on the vocals, this track could easily be passed off as one of the tunes that didn’t quite make it on to Therapy’s ‘Troublegum’, and in my book that is no small achievement. <cite>Pete Habert</cite>
