## Sohnee – Twenty Years On

Sohnee celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2019… but where are Steve and Duncan now?

Duncan P. Bradshaw is an acclaimed indie author of bizarro and horror titles that span a range of gory subjects from zombies, to killer appliances, and cannibal nuns (from outer space). His unusual style and eccentric ideas make his stories stand-out as uniquely offbeat.

Cannibal Nuns from Outer Space

S. M. Fenton is an author of Gothic Tales and mystery novels that draw on Shelley, Le Fanu, and Lovecraft from the horror genre, and Conan-Doyle and Christie from the crime genre.
