We were asked about the ten year anniversary and here’s what we said…

Duncan says:

> Always seemed to be dogged by bad luck and a Spinal Tap-esque drummer situation. No sooner had we got one, then some force majeure would scupper our plans. Our first gig was the same, a few days before, in an attempt to relive his youth, Steve broke his arm skateboarding, so we then had to get a guitarist in…. never did anything by half.
>
> Thoroughly enjoyed making music with Steve, never a chore, in hindsight I think I should’ve been more motivated and got off my ass. Personal highlight was Jude the Obscene live, thought we managed a decent attempt at an excellent song.

Steve says:

> It was always hard to get the same three people into the same venue at the same time, but we never cancelled a single show, thanks to contributions from folks in other bands who learned the songs really fast – sometime on the night!
>
> Duncan and I wanted to gig more than we practised to keep the songs raw and fresh and this made every live show feel really special for us. The Four Foot Snake nights were a real treat and it was great to play with some amazing local bands. I really enjoyed being the support band for Harsh, Uniting The Elements, The Sonic Underground, Alaskan Pipeline, Little Green, The Tattood Love Gods and Radiate.
