Taken from [Cicatrization](/discography/cicatrization/)

Sun-in bleach and quite a scene\
Stick on lips and bits like plasticine\
Whatâ€™s inside? I know you try to hide the lines\
under orange coloured cream

Surgery short stay\
Surgery same stay\
What do you want to change?

Rub-on tan and stick on chest\
Perhaps they should have pumped a little less\
One is high and the other goes too low\
you look cross-eyed you look a mess
