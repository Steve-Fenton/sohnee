Taken from [Shatter](/discography/shatter/)

I look to find my bitter end\
to kill my loneliness and be myself again\
I brace my skin against the pain\
I need to feel your kiss but there’s no end to this loneliness

I feel so lonely\
I feel so lonely *yeah*\
It makes my heart bleed\
each night it kills me\
It kills me\
It kills me

I press my face against the floor\
with no escape I lie hoping to find a cure\
After all this time it hurts more\
I need escape or bliss but there’s no end to this loneliness

On shattered dreams like glass I hope\
although return is now impossible for both\
My mind repeats the words you spoke\
I need to feel your kiss but there’s no end to this loneliness
