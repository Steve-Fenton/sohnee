Taken from [Cicatrization](/discography/cicatrization/)

She was crying herself dry\
over another dilemma she sighs\
Making a misery out of us all\
making a mess of our lives

‘And I’m wasting all my day\
trying to make it get better’ she says\
Making a misery out of us all\
losing our chance for success

Sleep while I choke on it all

Tonight everyone comes around\
making the most of us all feeling down\
Making a misery out of us all\
trying to turn it around

Cry until you can’t open your eyes\
until it’s better or until I die\
Making a misery out of us all\
making a mess of our lives
