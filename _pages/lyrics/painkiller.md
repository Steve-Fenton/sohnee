Taken from [Cicatrization](/discography/cicatrization/)

Bring it up and throw it out\
so that’s what this was all about\
So life was hard and now it’s done\
you search for something but it’s gone

You’re starting early, stopping late\
it’s insufficient for your taste\
It doesn’t fit\
it makes you sick\
but it’s something you can’t admit

You’re out of touch, it means too much\
to all you superstars and sluts\
You checked it out and I don’t doubt\
the needles all you’ve got left now

You’re throwing up and keeping calm\
those analgesics work like charms\
If you’re too stupid too be sure\
you’d better take a couple more

Your life’s a blur you stumble on\
That something special must have gone\
You’re just a shell\
and nothing else\
you lost your mind and lost yourself

Your pill won’t take away the pain\
they leave you numb now your insane\
and now there’s nothing left to gain…
