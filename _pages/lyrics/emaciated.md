Taken from [Cicatrization](/discography/cicatrization/)

Going down, going down lose a pound\
growing up, throwing up without a sound\
living up, giving up, don’t eat enough\
you look rough.

Everything, everything has a price\
think you’re deep? you’re too cheap to look nice\
dropping in, shopping in the sale\
you look pale.

Count the clones they’re here to stay\
Throwing up and two weeks late\
Count the clones they’re here to stay\
And they’re looking underweight

Swallow down, choke another slim pill\
disregard, disregard you feel ill\
living up, giving up, don’t eat enough\
you look rough.

That’s a small, such a small dress you’re in\
looking ill, still you think you’re not thin\
dropping in, shopping in the sale\
you look pale.
