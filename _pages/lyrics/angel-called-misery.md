Taken from [Pictures of Angels](/discography/pictures-of-angels/)

We work so hard but to what end\
is there an angel you can send\
to take me far away from here?

I live my life without a goal\
send her to me to save my soul\
and get me through another year

Angel calling out to me\
angel’s name is misery\
she takes me home, she takes me home

An angel comes and we feel safe\
our souls like brittle glass she breaks\
and casts us down from bleeding hands

She shares our grief and feels our pain\
I think that she must feel the same\
with bleeding skin she understands

Angel calling out I know\
angel calls me I must go\
angel’s all that I can see

Angel whispers ‘I feel safe’\
angel beats this twist of fate\
angel’s calling out to me
