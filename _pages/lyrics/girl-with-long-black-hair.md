Taken from [Cicatrization](/discography/cicatrization/)

She’s got a needle full of hope\
got a chair, and got a rope\
she writes a special note

‘Look at me I’m breaking free\
by a window by the sea’\
She’s an angel on the breeze\

She whispers to me, ‘do it again…\
…do it again, do it again’\
She whispers to me.

‘Once I tried with a carving knife.\
I overdosed on my birthday night…\
 …maybe it’s time to get it right’

Silhouette against the sky\
She’s gonna teach herself to fly\
with her long black hair on fire
