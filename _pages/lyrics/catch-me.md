Taken from [Shatter](/discography/shatter/)

A thousand people swarm in view\
but I can only look at you\
You’re an angel but you don’t know\
don’t be afraid to let it show

I feel your skin and feel you breathe\
this night is too short, I can’t leave\
I only wanted a one night stand\
but my heart’s frozen like I never planned

And I’m desperate to feel anything at all\
And I want you to catch me before I fall\
Was it just a dream or were you here with me?

I can’t forget that time we kissed\
A fragile memory of a night of bliss\
And I replay it in my head\
that perfect moment that we shared in bed

I’ve never felt a touch like yours\
in secret on the second floor\
and for that moment I felt alive\
so painful when it gets denied
