Taken from [Cicatrization](/discography/cicatrization/)

You whisper to me ‘sign your name\
across my arm I love the pain’\
My name is on you fading-blue\
It’s in the mirror. it says that I love you

You smile sweetly, who’d have known\
what’s in your head, you’re out of control\
And you’re no angel, still I care\
you’re letting go and bleeding everywhere

Well I’m impressed *yeah yeah*\
I should have guessed *yeah yeah*\
The way you’re dressed *yeah yeah*\
You look a mess *yeah yeah*

You’re suicidal, it turns me on\
It gives me kicks, I know it’s wrong\
but we’re not kids when we cut our skin\
open it up to let the answers in.
