Taken from [Shatter](/discography/shatter/)

I’ve got to learn to control my rage\
but I’m suffocated now I think you’ve got me caged\
I’d die right now for my escape\
dead eyes knife tight in hand and I’m about to break

I just wanted to forget but you remind me of how I was\
of what I was and what I lost\
you always tried to make the best\
the best of it\
but not me

I think I realised too late\
I don’t want to take the blame but I don’t believe in fate\
so how did you get in to that state?\
rust on my fingers scratching, pulling at my face

You were never around to absolve my sin\
I trembled alone in darkness clutching at my skin\
and now you’re on your knees again\
an evil angel praying for me to go insane
